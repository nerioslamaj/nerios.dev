        "This project has been implemented to accomplish the module FC7P01, M.Sc. Computing Science and Information Systems of the M.Sc. in the area of Computing conducted by the London Metropolitan University.",
        "Through this project, we used a set of user data collected through 1 hour of observation where multiple sessions from different users have occurred, and through this method, we categorised the users as buying and non-buying users. This set of data will serve to train the machine learning algorithms, which consist of Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine. Since these data structures offer a good insight on how a user interacts with the web app and many personal and session identifiers, e.g. where the user comes from, what platform they are using, what products and how many products they see — considering the data in our research data, we have some scalar data which will serve to train the Support Vector Machine algorithm and some string data which will serve to train Naive Bayes algorithm.",
        "By categorising the users in two main categories as buyers and non-buyers, we will be able to find patterns of behaviour on each of these categories with the help of classification algorithms mentioned above and predict for the future users whether they are potential buyers or not.",

This problem is interesting to be solved because it is a problem that almost every adult has and the impact that it has in people’s lives is huge. Keeping track of your personal finances helps a lot on organising this important part of our life. Through the Financial App users are going to store their income, set saving goals, keep track of their expenses and recognise spending habits which they can improve.",
