The manual old ways to managing money, like note keeping, spreadsheets can get outdated and hard to maintain, so digital solutions are more preferable to approach this problem. This problem is interesting to be solved because it is a problem that almost every adult has and the impact that it has in people’s lives is huge. Keeping track of your personal finances helps a lot on organising this important part of our life. Through the Financial App users are going to store their income, set saving goals, keep track of their expenses and recognise spending habits which they can improve.",
